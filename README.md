# Observatory
Observatory control system
It is an attemp to control my observatory.
I based the hardware on an Arduino Mega 1280 which is more than enough.
Ideally I would have developped it on a bluepill or so but had no harware available.
it is working with Kstars and indi with "Dome Scripting Gateway"
The scripts are under Doc
